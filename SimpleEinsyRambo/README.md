This is the config file for a Simple Pro upgraded with an Einsy Rambo board. 
Updating the electronics is not a small task. Find an overview here: http://sodesne.com/blog/2019/4/16/simpleeinsyrambo-build.

This file was based off the config file that was developed by Ultimachine [here](https://github.com/ultimachine/Marlin/tree/marlin-1.1.5-einsy0.5c), as well as DrPhil3D's work on the [ModernMarlin](https://github.com/Printrbot/printrboardmodernmarlin/tree/master/Simple_Pro/Simple%20Pro%202016%20Marlin%202.0%20Einsy%20Retro%20-%20Rambo) project.

These settings print a benchy beautifully as long as you use
conservative move/print speeds. I've been using 50mm/s max. If I turn
up the speed too high, I've found that occasionally I get layer
shifts. This may be fix-able with more settings tuning.
