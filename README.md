# MarlinConfigs

This (poorly named) repository includes config files for controller board + device combos I use. This includes several Marlin config files for printers I am using.

You should be able to check out the latest Marlin 1.1.x software and build for your machine after copying the config files over from the machine folder. 

To build Marlin on your machine, follow the instructions [here](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install.html) (I use the PlatformIO CLI). 

Currently, the following machines are included:

### SimpleEinsyRambo

Printrbot Simple Pro chassis using an [Einsy Rambo](https://ultimachine.com/products/einsy-rambo-1-1) as the controller board.

### Model3Rambo

Printrbot Model3 using a [Rambo v1.4](https://ultimachine.com/products/rambo-1-4) as the controller board. 

### FaboolDSmoothie

A Fabool DS laser cutter with a [Cohesion3D Laserboard](https://cohesion3d.com/shop/controllers/cohesion3d-laserboard/) running [Smoothieware](http://www.smoothieware.org)
