# MarlinConfigs

This repository includes Marlin config files for printers I am using.

You should be able to check out the latest Marlin FW and build for your machine after copying the config files over from the machine folder. 

To build Marlin on your machine, follow the instructions [here](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install.html) (I use the PlatformIO CLI). 

Currently, the following machines are supported:

### SimpleEinsyRambo

Printrbot Simple Pro chassis (and original hotend, z-probe, etc.) using an [Einsy Rambo](https://ultimachine.com/products/einsy-rambo-1-1) as the controller board.
